### Coding test ###
1. <b>Write a method that takes an int array and a int target value as parameters. The int Array will be a guaranteed to be a sorted array of unique positive values. Have the method find the index in the target value if it exist in the array.  If not, return -1.  Time complexity allowed:  O ( log n )</b>

Example: </br>
int[] array:  {1,2,3,4,5,6,10,20,50} </br>
Target: 20 </br>
Return would equal 7. </br>

2. <b>Write a method to calculate the value of n^m. The method MUST have a time complexity of less than O(n); m can be any int value (negative and positive)</b>

3. <b>Write a program to remove duplicates from an array in Java without using the Java Collection API.</b>
